When it comes to any technological issue, chances are, there’s a blog post out there that has exactly what I’m looking for.

## Why
After seeing many posts around the web describing the usefulness of technical blogs, I decided it was time to start one. As I wrap up my CS, I’ll write about different technical things I have to solve or play with.

```emacs-lisp
(defun start-blog ()
  (message "here we go..."))

(start-blog)
```
